### Material Ui
It is very difficult to adjust material ui with react 18. Because every documnet of material ui is for react 17 i guess. 
To add dependency write below command : 
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled // To install material ui
npm install @mui/styles --force // To force install the styles
